** [BREAKING] This release contains two very minor breaking changes (don't panic).
   1. ~args.inputs.mouse.point~ no longer returns a ~Tuple/Array~ and
      instead returns a ~Hash~ with ~x~ and ~y~ keys.

      NOTE: You will ONLY see an issue with this change if you were
      destructing the ~Tuple~.

      Lines like the following:

      #+begin_src ruby
        # destructure tuple no longer supported
        x, y = args.inputs.mouse.point
      #+end_src

      Must be changed to:

      #+begin_src ruby
        # Hash is returned (which cannot be destructured)
        point = args.inputs.mouse.point
        x, y = point.x, point.y
      #+end_src

   2. ~args.inputs.directional_vector~ has a similar change and can no longer
       be destructured.

   That's it for the breaking changes!
** [Pro] [iOS] C Extensions fixed so that they are accepted by TestFlight.
   A sample app has been added that shows how to package C Extensions for iOS:
   =/samples/12_c_extensions/05_ios_c_extensions/=
** [Pro] [Android] Android SDK target is now version 33 (android-ndk-r25b).
** [Bugfix] [Pro] ~all_screen_max_scale~ in combination with ~highdpi~ is respected for both
   landscape and portrait games.
** [Samples] Turn based RPG sample app has been added.
   The sample app is located at: =./samples/99_genre_rpg_turn_based/turn_based_battle=.
** [Performance] Performance improvements to ~Entities~.
   Both ~args.state.new_entity~ and ~args.state.new_entity_strict~
   have gotten some performance improvements. The perf boost to
   ~new_entity_strict~ is significant.
** [Performance] [Support] ~args.gtk.warn_array_primitives!~ added.
   While array based primitives are simple to create, they come with a performance
   penalty. If you find that you're having performance issues, you can use ~warn_array_primitives~
   to find places in your code where array primitives are used/created
   (so you can convert them to ~Hashes~):

   #+begin_src ruby
     def tick args
       # add this line to the top of your tick method
       args.gtk.warn_array_primitives!

       # a log entry will be printed to the Console anywhere array primitives are being used

       # example
       args.outputs.labels << [100, 100, "Hello"]

       # example
       rect_1 = [10, 100, 50, 50]
       rect_2 = [10, 100, 50, 50]
       args.geometry.intersect_rect? rect_1, rect_2
     end
   #+end_src
** [Support] Added out of bounds warning for sprite's ~(source|tile)_(x|y|w|h)~ properties.
   You will be warned if a specified source/tile rect goes past the boundaries of a sprite.

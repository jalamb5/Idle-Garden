### Mouse Click - main.rb
```ruby
  # ./samples/05_mouse/01_mouse_click/app/main.rb
  =begin

   APIs listing that haven't been encountered in previous sample apps:

   - product: Returns an array of all combinations of elements from all arrays.

     For example, [1,2].product([1,2]) would return the following array...
     [[1,1], [1,2], [2,1], [2,2]]
     More than two arrays can be given to product and it will still work,
     such as [1,2].product([1,2],[3,4]). What would product return in this case?

     Answer:
     [[1,1,3],[1,1,4],[1,2,3],[1,2,4],[2,1,3],[2,1,4],[2,2,3],[2,2,4]]

   - num1.fdiv(num2): Returns the float division (will have a decimal) of the two given numbers.
     For example, 5.fdiv(2) = 2.5 and 5.fdiv(5) = 1.0

   - yield: Allows you to call a method with a code block and yield to that block.

   Reminders:

   - Hash#inside_rect?: Returns true or false depending on if the point is inside the rect.

   - String interpolation: Uses #{} syntax; everything between the #{ and the } is evaluated
     as Ruby code, and the placeholder is replaced with its corresponding value or result.

   - args.inputs.mouse.click: This property will be set if the mouse was clicked.

   - Ternary operator (?): Will evaluate a statement (just like an if statement)
     and perform an action if the result is true or another action if it is false.

   - reject: Removes elements from a collection if they meet certain requirements.

   - args.outputs.borders: An array. The values generate a border.
     The parameters are [X, Y, WIDTH, HEIGHT, RED, GREEN, BLUE]
     For more information about borders, go to mygame/documentation/03-solids-and-borders.md.

   - args.outputs.labels: An array. The values generate a label.
     The parameters are [X, Y, TEXT, SIZE, ALIGNMENT, RED, GREEN, BLUE, ALPHA, FONT STYLE]
     For more information about labels, go to mygame/documentation/02-labels.

### Mouse Move - main.rb
```ruby
  # ./samples/05_mouse/02_mouse_move/app/main.rb
  =begin

   Reminders:

   - find_all: Finds all elements of a collection that meet certain requirements.
     For example, in this sample app, we're using find_all to find all zombies that have intersected
     or hit the player's sprite since these zombies have been killed.

   - args.inputs.keyboard.key_down.KEY: Determines if a key is being held or pressed.
     Stores the frame the "down" event occurred.
     For more information about the keyboard, go to mygame/documentation/06-keyboard.md.

   - args.outputs.sprites: An array. The values generate a sprite.
     The parameters are [X, Y, WIDTH, HEIGHT, PATH, ANGLE, ALPHA, RED, GREEN, BLUE]
     For more information about sprites, go to mygame/documentation/05-sprites.md.

   - args.state.new_entity: Used when we want to create a new object, like a sprite or button.
     When we want to create a new object, we can declare it as a new entity and then define
     its properties. (Remember, you can use state to define ANY property and it will
     be retained across frames.)

   - String interpolation: Uses #{} syntax; everything between the #{ and the } is evaluated
     as Ruby code, and the placeholder is replaced with its corresponding value or result.

   - map: Ruby method used to transform data; used in arrays, hashes, and collections.
     Can be used to perform an action on every element of a collection, such as multiplying
     each element by 2 or declaring every element as a new entity.

   - sample: Chooses a random element from the array.

   - reject: Removes elements that meet certain requirements.
     In this sample app, we're removing/rejecting zombies that reach the center of the screen. We're also
     rejecting zombies that were killed more than 30 frames ago.

### Mouse Move Paint App - main.rb
```ruby
  # ./samples/05_mouse/03_mouse_move_paint_app/app/main.rb
  =begin

   APIs listing that haven't been encountered in previous sample apps:

   - Floor: Method that returns an integer number smaller than or equal to the original with no decimal.

     For example, if we have a variable, a = 13.7, and we called floor on it, it would look like this...
     puts a.floor()
     which would print out 13.
     (There is also a ceil method, which returns an integer number greater than or equal to the original
     with no decimal. If we had called ceil on the variable a, the result would have been 14.)

   Reminders:

   - Hashes: Collection of unique keys and their corresponding values. The value can be found
     using their keys.

     For example, if we have a "numbers" hash that stores numbers in English as the
     key and numbers in Spanish as the value, we'd have a hash that looks like this...
     numbers = { "one" => "uno", "two" => "dos", "three" => "tres" }
     and on it goes.

     Now if we wanted to find the corresponding value of the "one" key, we could say
     puts numbers["one"]
     which would print "uno" to the console.

   - args.state.new_entity: Used when we want to create a new object, like a sprite or button.
     In this sample app, new_entity is used to create a new button that clears the grid.
     (Remember, you can use state to define ANY property and it will be retained across frames.)

   - args.inputs.mouse.click.point.(x|y): The x and y location of the mouse.

   - args.inputs.mouse.click.point.created_at: The frame the mouse click occurred in.

   - args.outputs.labels: An array. The values in the array generate a label.
     The parameters are [X, Y, TEXT, SIZE, ALIGN, RED, GREEN, BLUE, ALPHA, FONT STYLE]
     For more information about labels, go to mygame/documentation/02-labels.md.

   - ARRAY#inside_rect?: Returns true or false depending on if the point is inside the rect.

### Coordinate Systems - main.rb
```ruby
  # ./samples/05_mouse/04_coordinate_systems/app/main.rb
  =begin

   APIs listing that haven't been encountered in previous sample apps:

   - args.inputs.mouse.click.position: Coordinates of the mouse's position on the screen.
     Unlike args.inputs.mouse.click.point, the mouse does not need to be pressed down for
     position to know the mouse's coordinates.
     For more information about the mouse, go to mygame/documentation/07-mouse.md.

   Reminders:

   - args.inputs.mouse.click: This property will be set if the mouse was clicked.

   - args.inputs.mouse.click.point.(x|y): The x and y location of the mouse.

   - String interpolation: Uses #{} syntax; everything between the #{ and the } is evaluated
     as Ruby code, and the placeholder is replaced with its corresponding value or result.

     In this sample app, string interpolation is used to show the current position of the mouse
     in a label.

   - args.outputs.labels: An array that generates a label.
     The parameters are [X, Y, TEXT, SIZE, ALIGN, RED, GREEN, BLUE, ALPHA, FONT STYLE]
     For more information about labels, go to mygame/documentation/02-labels.md.

   - args.outputs.solids: An array that generates a solid.
     The parameters are [X, Y, WIDTH, HEIGHT, RED, GREEN, BLUE, ALPHA]
     For more information about solids, go to mygame/documentation/03-solids-and-borders.md.

   - args.outputs.lines: An array that generates a line.

### Moving Objects - main.rb
```ruby
  # ./samples/04_physics_and_collisions/02_moving_objects/app/main.rb
  =begin

   APIs listing that haven't been encountered in previous sample apps:

   - Hashes: Collection of unique keys and their corresponding values. The value can be found
     using their keys.

     For example, if we have a "numbers" hash that stores numbers in English as the
     key and numbers in Spanish as the value, we'd have a hash that looks like this...
     numbers = { "one" => "uno", "two" => "dos", "three" => "tres" }
     and on it goes.

     Now if we wanted to find the corresponding value of the "one" key, we could say
     puts numbers["one"]
     which would print "uno" to the console.

   - num1.greater(num2): Returns the greater value.
     For example, if we have the command
     puts 4.greater(3)
     the number 4 would be printed to the console since it has a greater value than 3.
     Similar to lesser, which returns the lesser value.

   - num1.lesser(num2): Finds the lower value of the given options.
     For example, in the statement
     a = 4.lesser(3)
     3 has a lower value than 4, which means that the value of a would be set to 3,
     but if the statement had been
     a = 4.lesser(5)
     4 has a lower value than 5, which means that the value of a would be set to 4.

   - reject: Removes elements from a collection if they meet certain requirements.
     For example, you can derive an array of odd numbers from an original array of
     numbers 1 through 10 by rejecting all elements that are even (or divisible by 2).

   - find_all: Finds all values that satisfy specific requirements.
     For example, you can find all elements of a collection that are divisible by 2
     or find all objects that have intersected with another object.

   - abs: Returns the absolute value.
     For example, the command
     (-30).abs
     would return 30 as a result.

   - map: Ruby method used to transform data; used in arrays, hashes, and collections.
     Can be used to perform an action on every element of a collection, such as multiplying
     each element by 2 or declaring every element as a new entity.

   Reminders:

   - args.inputs.keyboard.KEY: Determines if a key has been pressed.
     For more information about the keyboard, take a look at mygame/documentation/06-keyboard.md.

   - ARRAY#intersect_rect?: Returns true or false depending on if the two rectangles intersect.

   - args.outputs.solids: An array. The values generate a solid.
     The parameters are [X, Y, WIDTH, HEIGHT, RED, GREEN, BLUE]
     For more information about solids, go to mygame/documentation/03-solids-and-borders.md.

### Entities - main.rb
```ruby
  # ./samples/04_physics_and_collisions/03_entities/app/main.rb
  =begin

   Reminders:

   - map: Ruby method used to transform data; used in arrays, hashes, and collections.
     Can be used to perform an action on every element of a collection, such as multiplying
     each element by 2 or declaring every element as a new entity.

   - reject: Removes elements from a collection if they meet certain requirements.
     For example, you can derive an array of odd numbers from an original array of
     numbers 1 through 10 by rejecting all elements that are even (or divisible by 2).

   - args.state.new_entity: Used when we want to create a new object, like a sprite or button.
     In this sample app, new_entity is used to define the properties of enemies and bullets.
     (Remember, you can use state to define ANY property and it will be retained across frames.)

   - args.outputs.labels: An array. The values generate a label on the screen.
     The parameters are [X, Y, TEXT, SIZE, ALIGN, RED, GREEN, BLUE, ALPHA, FONT STYLE]

   - ARRAY#intersect_rect?: Returns true or false depending on if the two rectangles intersect.

   - args.inputs.mouse.click.point.(x|y): The x and y location of the mouse.

### Box Collision - main.rb
```ruby
  # ./samples/04_physics_and_collisions/04_box_collision/app/main.rb
  =begin

   APIs listing that haven't been encountered in previous sample apps:

   - first: Returns the first element of the array.
     For example, if we have an array
     numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
     and we call first by saying
     numbers.first
     the number 1 will be returned because it is the first element of the numbers array.

   - num1.idiv(num2): Divides two numbers and returns an integer.
     For example,
     16.idiv(3) = 5, because 16 / 3 is 5.33333 returned as an integer.
     16.idiv(4) = 4, because 16 / 4 is 4 and already has no decimal.

   Reminders:

   - find_all: Finds all values that satisfy specific requirements.

   - ARRAY#intersect_rect?: An array with at least four values is
     considered a rect. The intersect_rect? function returns true
     or false depending on if the two rectangles intersect.

   - reject: Removes elements from a collection if they meet certain requirements.

### Box Collision 2 - main.rb
```ruby
  # ./samples/04_physics_and_collisions/05_box_collision_2/app/main.rb
  =begin
   APIs listing that haven't been encountered in previous sample apps:

   - times: Performs an action a specific number of times.
     For example, if we said
     5.times puts "Hello DragonRuby",
     then we'd see the words "Hello DragonRuby" printed on the console 5 times.

   - split: Divides a string into substrings based on a delimiter.
     For example, if we had a command
     "DragonRuby is awesome".split(" ")
     then the result would be
     ["DragonRuby", "is", "awesome"] because the words are separated by a space delimiter.

   - join: Opposite of split; converts each element of array to a string separated by delimiter.
     For example, if we had a command
     ["DragonRuby","is","awesome"].join(" ")
     then the result would be
     "DragonRuby is awesome".

   Reminders:

   - to_s: Returns a string representation of an object.
     For example, if we had
     500.to_s
     the string "500" would be returned.
     Similar to to_i, which returns an integer representation of an object.

   - elapsed_time: How many frames have passed since the click event.

   - args.outputs.labels: An array. Values in the array generate labels on the screen.
     The parameters are: [X, Y, TEXT, SIZE, ALIGN, RED, GREEN, BLUE, ALPHA, FONT STYLE]
     For more information about labels, go to mygame/documentation/02-labels.md.

   - inputs.mouse.down: Determines whether or not the mouse is being pressed down.
     The position of the mouse when it is pressed down can be found using inputs.mouse.down.point.(x|y).

   - first: Returns the first element of the array.

   - num1.idiv(num2): Divides two numbers and returns an integer.

   - find_all: Finds all values that satisfy specific requirements.

   - ARRAY#intersect_rect?: Returns true or false depending on if two rectangles intersect.

   - reject: Removes elements from a collection if they meet certain requirements.

   - String interpolation: Uses #{} syntax; everything between the #{ and the } is evaluated
     as Ruby code, and the placeholder is replaced with its corresponding value or result.

### Jump Physics - main.rb
```ruby
  # ./samples/04_physics_and_collisions/07_jump_physics/app/main.rb
  =begin

   Reminders:

   - args.state.new_entity: Used when we want to create a new object, like a sprite or button.
     For example, if we want to create a new button, we would declare it as a new entity and
     then define its properties. (Remember, you can use state to define ANY property and it will
     be retained across frames.)

   - args.outputs.solids: An array. The values generate a solid.
     The parameters for a solid are [X, Y, WIDTH, HEIGHT, RED, GREEN, BLUE]
     For more information about solids, go to mygame/documentation/03-solids-and-borders.md.

   - num1.greater(num2): Returns the greater value.

   - Hashes: Collection of unique keys and their corresponding values. The value can be found
     using their keys.

   - ARRAY#inside_rect?: Returns true or false depending on if the point is inside the rect.

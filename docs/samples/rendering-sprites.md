### Animation Using Separate Pngs - main.rb
```ruby
  # ./samples/03_rendering_sprites/01_animation_using_separate_pngs/app/main.rb
  =begin
   Reminders:

   - String interpolation: Uses #{} syntax; everything between the #{ and the } is evaluated
     as Ruby code, and the placeholder is replaced with its corresponding value or result.

     In this sample app, we're using string interpolation to iterate through images in the
     sprites folder using their image path names.

   - args.outputs.sprites: An array. Values in this array generate sprites on the screen.
     The parameters are [X, Y, WIDTH, HEIGHT, IMAGE PATH]
     For more information about sprites, go to mygame/documentation/05-sprites.md.

   - args.outputs.labels: An array. Values in the array generate labels on the screen.
     The parameters are [X, Y, TEXT, SIZE, ALIGNMENT, RED, GREEN, BLUE, ALPHA, FONT STYLE]
     For more information about labels, go to mygame/documentation/02-labels.md.

   - args.inputs.keyboard.key_down.KEY: Determines if a key is in the down state, or pressed.
     Stores the frame that key was pressed on.
     For more information about the keyboard, go to mygame/documentation/06-keyboard.md.

  # This is the entry point to your game. The `tick` method
  # executes at 60 frames per second. There are two methods
  # in this tick "entry point": `looping_animation`, and the
  # second method is `one_time_animation`.

### Color And Rotation - main.rb
```ruby
  # ./samples/03_rendering_sprites/04_color_and_rotation/app/main.rb
  =begin
   APIs listing that haven't been encountered in previous sample apps:

   - merge: Returns a hash containing the contents of two original hashes.
     Merge does not allow duplicate keys, so the value of a repeated key
     will be overwritten.

     For example, if we had two hashes
     h1 = { "a" => 1, "b" => 2}
     h2 = { "b" => 3, "c" => 3}
     and we called the command
     h1.merge(h2)
     the result would the following hash
     { "a" => 1, "b" => 3, "c" => 3}.

   Reminders:

   - Hashes: Collection of unique keys and their corresponding values. The value can be found
     using their keys.
     In this sample app, we're using a hash to create a sprite.

   - args.outputs.sprites: An array. The values generate a sprite.
     The parameters are [X, Y, WIDTH, HEIGHT, PATH, ANGLE, ALPHA, RED, GREEN, BLUE]
     Before continuing with this sample app, it is HIGHLY recommended that you look
     at mygame/documentation/05-sprites.md.

   - args.inputs.keyboard.key_held.KEY: Determines if a key is being pressed.
     For more information about the keyboard, go to mygame/documentation/06-keyboard.md.

   - args.inputs.controller_one: Takes input from the controller based on what key is pressed.
     For more information about the controller, go to mygame/documentation/08-controllers.md.

   - num1.lesser(num2): Finds the lower value of the given options.

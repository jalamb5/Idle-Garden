- 000154 [Game] * WARNING:
Your average framerate dropped below 60 fps for two seconds.

The average FPS was 49.96774193548387.

** How To Disable Warning
If this warning is getting annoying put the following in your tick method:

#+begin_src
  args.gtk.log_level = :off
#+end_src

* INFO: Framerate Diagnostics
You can display these diagnostics using:

#+begin_src
  def tick args
    # ....

    # IMPORTANT: Put this at the END of the ~tick~ method.
    args.outputs.debug << args.gtk.framerate_diagnostics_primitives
  end
#+end_src

** Draw Calls: ~<<~ Invocation Perf Counter
Here is how many times ~args.outputs.PRIMITIVE_ARRAY <<~ was called:

  17 times invoked.

If the number above is high, consider batching primitives so you can lower the invocation of ~<<~. For example.

Instead of:

#+begin_src
  args.state.enemies.map do |e|
    e.alpha = 128
    args.outputs.sprites << e # <-- ~args.outputs.sprites <<~ is invoked a lot
  end
#+end_src

Do this:

#+begin_src
  args.outputs.sprites << args.state
                              .enemies
                              .map do |e| # <-- ~args.outputs.sprites <<~ is only invoked once.
    e.alpha = 128
    e
  end
#+end_src

** Array Primitives
~Primitives~ represented as an ~Array~ (~Tuple~) are great for prototyping, but are not as performant as using a ~Hash~.

Here is the number of ~Array~ primitives that were encountered:

  2 Array Primitives.

If the number above is high, consider converting them to hashes. For example.

Instead of:

#+begin_src
  args.outputs.sprites << [0, 0, 100, 100, 'sprites/enemy.png']
#+begin_end

Do this:

#+begin_src
  args.outputs.sprites << { x: 0,
                            y: 0,
                            w: 100,
                            h: 100,
                            path: 'sprites/enemy.png' }
#+begin_end

** Primitive Counts
Here are the draw counts ordered by lowest to highest z order:

PRIMITIVE   COUNT, STATIC COUNT
solids:     2, 0
sprites:    4, 0
primitives: 10, 0
labels:     7, 0
lines:      0, 0

debug:      0, 0

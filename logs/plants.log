- 000000 [Game] * WARNING: ~Hash#border~ is deprecated becuase it's poorly named. Use ~Hash#border!~ instead.
This method will stay here for backwards compatibility. But, consider using one of the following methods:
** Option 1: ~:border! &OPTIONAL additional_keys_to_merge~
This will mutate the current hash in-place. It's identical to the current method you're using,
but better signifies that a side effect is occuring (because of the ~!~ at the end).
*** Example
Here is an example of how your code may change.

and be notified of other places you're using this function.

Your average framerate dropped below 60 fps for two seconds.

The average FPS was 49.89629629629629.

** How To Disable Warning
If this warning is getting annoying put the following in your tick method:

#+begin_src
  args.gtk.log_level = :off
#+end_src

* INFO: Framerate Diagnostics
You can display these diagnostics using:

** Draw Calls: ~<<~ Invocation Perf Counter
Here is how many times ~args.outputs.PRIMITIVE_ARRAY <<~ was called:

  10 times invoked.

If the number above is high, consider batching primitives so you can lower the invocation of ~<<~. For example.

Instead of:

    e.alpha = 128
    args.outputs.sprites << e # <-- ~args.outputs.sprites <<~ is invoked a lot

** Array Primitives
~Primitives~ represented as an ~Array~ (~Tuple~) are great for prototyping, but are not as performant as using a ~Hash~.

Here is the number of ~Array~ primitives that were encountered:

If the number above is high, consider converting them to hashes. For example.

Instead of:

- 000238 [Game] * WARNING:
Your average framerate dropped below 60 fps for two seconds.

The average FPS was 38.98319327731092.

** How To Disable Warning
If this warning is getting annoying put the following in your tick method:

#+begin_src
  args.gtk.log_level = :off
#+end_src

* INFO: Framerate Diagnostics
You can display these diagnostics using:

#+begin_src
  def tick args
    # ....

    # IMPORTANT: Put this at the END of the ~tick~ method.
    args.outputs.debug << args.gtk.framerate_diagnostics_primitives
  end
#+end_src

** Draw Calls: ~<<~ Invocation Perf Counter
Here is how many times ~args.outputs.PRIMITIVE_ARRAY <<~ was called:

  10 times invoked.

If the number above is high, consider batching primitives so you can lower the invocation of ~<<~. For example.

Instead of:

#+begin_src
  args.state.enemies.map do |e|
    e.alpha = 128
    args.outputs.sprites << e # <-- ~args.outputs.sprites <<~ is invoked a lot
  end

Do this:

                              .map do |e| # <-- ~args.outputs.sprites <<~ is only invoked once.

** Array Primitives
~Primitives~ represented as an ~Array~ (~Tuple~) are great for prototyping, but are not as performant as using a ~Hash~.

Here is the number of ~Array~ primitives that were encountered:

Instead of:

#+begin_src
  args.outputs.sprites << [0, 0, 100, 100, 'sprites/enemy.png']
#+begin_end

Do this:

** Draw Calls: ~<<~ Invocation Perf Counter
Here is how many times ~args.outputs.PRIMITIVE_ARRAY <<~ was called:

  10 times invoked.

If the number above is high, consider batching primitives so you can lower the invocation of ~<<~. For example.

Instead of:

#+begin_src
  args.state.enemies.map do |e|
    e.alpha = 128
    args.outputs.sprites << e # <-- ~args.outputs.sprites <<~ is invoked a lot
  end

Do this:

#+begin_src
  args.outputs.sprites << args.state
                              .enemies
                              .map do |e| # <-- ~args.outputs.sprites <<~ is only invoked once.
    e.alpha = 128

** Array Primitives
~Primitives~ represented as an ~Array~ (~Tuple~) are great for prototyping, but are not as performant as using a ~Hash~.

Here is the number of ~Array~ primitives that were encountered:

  1 Array Primitives.

If the number above is high, consider converting them to hashes. For example.

Instead of:

#+begin_src
  args.outputs.sprites << [0, 0, 100, 100, 'sprites/enemy.png']
#+begin_end

Do this:

#+begin_src
  args.outputs.sprites << { x: 0,
                            y: 0,
                            w: 100,
